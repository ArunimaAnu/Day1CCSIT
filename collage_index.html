        College life is a big transition from school life. We go through a lot of changes when we enter 
        college. Our schools were a safe place where we had grown up and spent half our lives. 
        The transition to college is so sudden that youâ€™re no longer protected by your teachers and 
        friends of your school time.College life poses a lot of challenges in front of you.place full of 
        unfamiliar faces where you need to mingle in. It teaches us to socialize and form opinions 
        of our own. In college, students learn their free will and they go on to become more confident 
        and composed.
